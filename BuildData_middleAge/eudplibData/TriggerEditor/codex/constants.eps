/* CONFIG NOTES
 * - Tune starting resources and per-second gains for economic pacing.
 * - Adjust stack limits and promotion thresholds for map size and player count.
 * - Balance victory territory count for desired match length.
 */

/* HOW TO EXTEND
 * - Add new constants for additional resources or buildings.
 * - Introduce arrays for AI players or factions if needed.
